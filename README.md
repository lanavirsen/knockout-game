## Rules

**Objective**  
Reach **45+** without hitting your chosen **knockout number**.

**Setup**  
Choose one knockout number: `6`, `7`, `8`, or `9`.

**Play**  
Click **Roll** to throw two six-sided dice.  
The sum is added to your score.

**Knockout**  
If a roll equals your knockout number, you **lose** - unless you spend your **Safe Roll**.

**Safe Roll**  
You have one **Safe Roll**. The first time you’d be knocked out, you may use it to ignore that knockout and continue. It can be used only once per game.

**Win**  
You **win** when your score reaches **45 or more** and you haven’t been knocked out.
